# Fasten Connect React Native SDK (Beta)

This project provides a React Native SDK for integrating Fasten Connect into your application. **Please note that this SDK is currently in beta and may not reflect the final version of the Fasten Connect React Native SDK.**

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **Yarn**
- **React Native CLI**
- A working React Native environment (iOS/Android)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Use `yarn` to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure the SDK**:
    - Replace `CUSTOMER_PUBLIC_ID` in the `App.js` file with your actual public ID provided by Fasten Connect.

4. **Run the application**:
    ```
   npx expo start
   ```

## Notes

- This SDK uses `WebView` to embed Fasten Connect functionality. Ensure your app has the necessary permissions and configurations for `WebView` to work correctly.
- Debugging is enabled by default in this beta version. Make sure to disable it in production by setting `webviewDebuggingEnabled` to `false`.

## Known Issues

- The SDK is in beta, and some features may not work as expected.
- Documentation and API stability are subject to change in future releases.
- Events from the SDK do not fully bubble up to the client application yet.
